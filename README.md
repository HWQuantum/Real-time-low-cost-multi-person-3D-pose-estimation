This folder contains the code and models of the project.  


You can find the models and the data at DOI : 10.17861/e85a6eae-13f9-4bcd-9dff-73f8107c09a2.

We provide one example for each scenario containing one, two or three people in the scene. 



## Dependencies 
Python 3.8.11
Tensorflow 2.4.1
Keras 2.4.0

## Run the tests
1. Download the models at the DOI : 10.17861/e85a6eae-13f9-4bcd-9dff-73f8107c09a2
2. Run Pixels2Pose.py --scenario=*number_people* with *number_people* = 1,2,3
